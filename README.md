### **My Journey**

When I started this course, I had minimal knowledge of web development and IT fundamentals. Over time, I developed the skills and confidence to create a fully functional, professional website. Here's a summary of my journey:

1. **Introduction to Web Development**:
   - Learned the basics of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
   - Understood how to structure a website and style it to look professional.

2. **Building the Foundation**:
   - Created simple websites with static content.
   - Experimented with responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices.

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Added interactivity using JavaScript, such as sliders and animations.
   - Worked with flexbox and grid layouts to create visually appealing designs.

4. **Portfolio Development**:
   - Planned and designed the structure of this portfolio website.
   - Organized the project into reusable components (e.g., header, footer).
   - Created individual pages for Home, About, Projects, and Contact.
   - Ensured accessibility and optimized the site for SEO.

5. **Hosting the Website**:
   - Learned how to upload and host the website using GitHub Pages.
   - Configured the folder structure and relative paths to ensure everything works seamlessly online.

This project is not just a demonstration of my technical skills but also a reflection of my dedication to learning and growing in the field of IT and web development.
